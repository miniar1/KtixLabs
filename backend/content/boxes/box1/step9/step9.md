## Copper Grounding Bar

### Definition
The copper grounding bar is an essential element in an electrical installation.  

### Main Roles
- Divert fault currents  
- Ensure personal safety  
- Protect equipment  
- Provide a stable electrical reference  

---

### Why Use Copper?
- **High conductivity** → fault current or earth leakage flows quickly to the ground, reducing risks of electric shock and fire.  
- **Safety & durability** → copper ensures reliable grounding over time.  
- **Comparison:**  
  - Aluminum or steel require additional precautions.  
  - Copper remains the best choice for industrial grounding systems.
