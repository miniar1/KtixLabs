# Install Selector Switch

First, the selector switch (#) needs to be dissembled because the fully assembled switch cannot pass through the Ø22 mm hole:

-Remove the contact blocks (NO/NC) from the back (Unclip or gently pull them off)
-Unscrew the fixing nut (Remove washer and nut)
-Separate the parts: Head (front operator) + Body + Nut

The selector switch is installed on the cabinet's left side:

-Insert the head from the front side of the panel.

-Check orientation (AUTO / MANUAL horizontal).

-Reinstall washer and nut from the back.

-Tighten securely (do not overtighten).

-Reclip the contact blocks.
