# Cable Motors (this step needs revisiting)
-Cable (U, V, W, PE, Br+, Br-) of motor (#) with the Harting 32B connector (#) (what motor? The actual motors? That are in the robot?? Or are talking about motor wires here?)

-Cable Encoder of motor (#) with connector CN2 of servo_drive (#)

(encoder of motor? Is this a component ? We didn’t install it or mention it before.)
(which servo drive?)

(“cable” ? You mean with the cables we soldered? This should be more detailed, it's unclear what to use for the cabling.).
