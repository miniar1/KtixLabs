## 2-Stage Terminal Block 2.5 mm² (x24)

### Definition
A **2-stage 2.5 mm² terminal block** (also called a double-decker terminal block) is used in industrial electrical cabinets to connect, distribute, and organize conductors.  
It allows two independent circuits to be connected on a single block, one above the other, saving space on the DIN rail.

### Role in an Electrical Cabinet
- **Connection of field cables** → sensors, buttons, actuators  
- **Distribution of power** → e.g., +24V / 0V  
- **Clear separation** → between control and power circuits  
- **Organization and labeling** → wires can be numbered for easy identification and maintenance
