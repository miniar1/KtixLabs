## DIN Rails (2 m)

### Definition
A DIN rail is a standard metal profile (often steel or aluminum) used to mount and organize electrical components inside a cabinet.

### Functions

- **Component mounting**  
  - Modular components clip directly onto the DIN rail  
  - Eliminates the need for screws or specific mounts for each device  
  - Enables quick and secure assembly  

- **Cabinet organization**  
  - All components aligned on the rail → clean and readable cabinet  
  - Facilitates identification and maintenance  

- **Modularity**  
  - Allows adding, removing, or replacing components easily  
  - Ideal for a 6-axis robot, where additional relays, servo drives, or terminal blocks may be added  

- **Safety**  
  - Components are solidly mounted, reducing risk of vibration or poor contact
