# MODULE 1: Electrical Cabinet of an Industrial Robot

An industrial electrical cabinet is designed to group, protect, and centralize control, distribution, monitoring, and automation equipment for electrical installations in an industrial environment.

## Main Functions
- **Power distribution**: via circuit breakers, terminal blocks  
- **Control**: buttons, relays  
- **Protection**: circuit breakers, fuses, grounding  
- **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**: indicator lights, emergency stop buttons

## 2. Main Components
- **Circuit breaker**: Protection against overcurrent or short circuits  
- **Switch**: Manual power ON/OFF  
- **Relay**: Switching of control circuits (often at 24V DC)  
- **Servo drives**: Ensure precise control of the robot’s axis motors  
- **24V Power Supply**: Provides voltage suitable for control circuits  
- **Indicator lights / Buttons**: User interface (status, control, and emergency stop)  
- **Terminal block**: Connection of motor cables, sensors, etc.  
- **220V AC Socket**: Provides electrical power to equipment
