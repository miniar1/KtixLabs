## Power Supply 24V 20A DR480-24 DIN Rail

### Definition
The **DR480-24** is the main 24V DC source for all control and auxiliary circuits in the industrial cabinet.

---

### Applications

- **Powering Servo Drive Logic / Control Signals**  
  - Drives (e.g., EL7-EC400N) require 24V DC for control circuits, separate from the main AC motor power.  

- **Powering Holding Brakes**  
  - Each motor has a spring-applied holding brake.  
  - Brake coils require 24V DC, supplied by DR480-24 through relay-controlled circuits.  

- **Powering Relays / 14-Pin Relay Bases**  
  - Provides 24V DC for relay coils controlling brakes or other signals.  
  - Relays act as an interface between low-voltage logic (e.g., Raspberry Pi) and high-current devices.

### Why DR480-24 is Critical
- **20A capacity** → enough to power multiple brakes, relays, and sensors simultaneously.  
- **DIN Rail mounting** → compact, professional industrial cabinet design.  
- **Stable 24V DC output** → ensures reliable operation of all control circuits and brakes.
